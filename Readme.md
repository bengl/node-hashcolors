colorhash
=========

**colorhash** introduces some commands corresponding to some hashing algorithms. These commands are:

* <code>md5hash</code>
* <code>sha1hash</code>
* <code>sha256hash</code>

Each of these takes in one paramater, which is either a string or a file. The data will be hashed using the relevant algorithm, and then instead of outputting the hash, the output is just a series of ANSI colors given by each pair of hex digits in the hash. Try it! It's much prettier than a number.

Installation
------------

    $ npm isntall -g colorhash
